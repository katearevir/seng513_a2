# SENG 513 ASSIGNMENT TWO - CHAT SYSTEM

## Instructions
1. Run `node server.js` on the terminal.
2. The server will be listening to `localhost:3000`.
3. If page is refreshed accidentally on `localhost:3000/chat`, user will be disconnected and redirected to registration page.

## Notes on Nickname and Colour
- On the registration page, hit Enter for default name and colour.
- To change the name of the user, type `/nick name` in the chat and hit Send.
- To change the colour, the button on the left side of the message input will modify the colour of the message (not necessary to hit Send, but future messages are the only ones changed).

## Starter Code
I used the resource provided in the Assignment PDF file to code the basic features of the server: https://socket.io/get-started/chat
